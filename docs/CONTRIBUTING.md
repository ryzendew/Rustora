- Test your changes manually in the GUI
- Test on Fedora 38+ or Nobara if possible

## Documentation

- Keep examples up to date
- Add comments to complex code sections

## Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:
- Your OS and version

We're always open to new ideas! Open an issue to discuss your feature request before implementing it to make sure it aligns with the project goals.
